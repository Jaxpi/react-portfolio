//WHAT I NEED TO DO STILL:

//HAVE LINK TO DEPLOYMENT AND GITHUB REPO FOR EACH PROJECT IN PORTFOLIO (MAYBE A MODAL POPUP ON EACH PIC WITH A BUTTON FOR EACH?)

// WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
// WHEN I enter text into the email address field THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address

//MAKE RESUME BUTTON FOR DOWNLOADING PDF VERSION OF RESUME WITH DUMMY PDF FOR UNDER CONSTRUCTION FOR NOW
// WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
// THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developerâ€™s proficiencies
