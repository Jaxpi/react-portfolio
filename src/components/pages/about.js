      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a recent graduate of Columbia University's Columbia Engineering
        Coding Boot Camp, where I developed the skills and techniques to be a
        well-rounded and knowledgeable full-stack software engineer. The program
        provided me working knowledge in a wide variety of coding technologies
        and languages including HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript, Bootstrap, DOM,
        RESTful API's, JQuery, JSON, AJAX, Node.js, ES6, OOP, Express, MySQL,
        GraphQL, NoSQL, Sequelize, Agile Development, Jest, Handlebars,
        Progressive Web Apps, Webpacks, Vite, Apollo Client/Server, Insomnia
        Core, VS Code, React, MERN Stacks, fundamentals of computer science, and
        others. <br></br><br></br>

      <p>
        I previously worked in the education field, but am seeking a
        career change full of new opportunities and challenges. In my spare time
        I enjoy traveling, hiking, music, singing, cooking, sports, films,
        Avatar: The Last Airbender, Korean shows on Netflix, and videogames.
