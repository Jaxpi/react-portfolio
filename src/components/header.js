      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a current student of Columbia University's Columbia Engineering
        Coding Boot Camp, where I am developing the skills and techniques to be
        a well-rounded and knowledgeable full-stack software engineer. I
        previously worked in the education field, but am seeking a career change
        full of new opportunities and challenges. In my spare time I enjoy
        traveling, hiking, music, singing, cooking, sports, films, Avatar: The
        Last Airbender, Korean shows on Netflix, and videogames, among others.
